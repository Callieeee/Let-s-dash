# Let-s-dash
### I will publish all my dash sample code in this repository.


This is my first appilcation built using dash. The data I am using is from Kaggle IMDB movie data. I built this app by learning and referencing a dash sample application from dash gallery. It helped me get familiar with dash.

In this simple application, you can find movies that you may be interested in. In addition to that, it also provide basic analysis on the trend of movies over the years.
